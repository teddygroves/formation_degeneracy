  abstract = {Equilibrium compositions of solutions of biochemical species can be calculated by use of general equilibrium computer programs that minimize the Gibbs energy. The standard Gibbs energies of formation and standard enthalpies of formation of the species in a biochemical system can be calculated by Gaussian reduction of the augmented transpose of the stoichiometric number matrix for the system. The conservation matrix, which is also needed for the calculation of the equilibrium composition, can be obtained in two ways. The hydrolysis of adenosine 5'-triphosphate in solutions containing magnesium ions can be treated by considering 17 species. The equilibrium composition and enthalpy are calculated before and after adding ATPase. This makes it possible to calculate DeltapH, DeltapMg, and the heat of reaction when ATPase is added.},

  abstract = {Standard Gibbs energies of reactions are increasingly being used in metabolic modeling for applying thermodynamic constraints on reaction rates, metabolite concentrations and kinetic parameters. The increasing scope and diversity of metabolic models has led scientists to look for genome-scale solutions that can estimate the standard Gibbs energy of all the reactions in metabolism. Group contribution methods greatly increase coverage, albeit at the price of decreased precision. We present here a way to combine the estimations of group contribution with the more accurate reactant contributions by decomposing each reaction into two parts and applying one of the methods on each of them. This method gives priority to the reactant contributions over group contributions while guaranteeing that all estimations will be consistent, i.e. will not violate the first law of thermodynamics. We show that there is a significant increase in the accuracy of our estimations compared to standard group contribution. Specifically, our cross-validation results show an 80\% reduction in the median absolute residual for reactions that can be derived by reactant contributions only. We provide the full framework and source code for deriving estimates of standard reaction Gibbs energy, as well as confidence intervals, and believe this will facilitate the wide use of thermodynamic data for a better understanding of metabolism.},

  abstract = {Reaction-equilibrium constants determine the metabolite concentrations necessary to drive flux through metabolic pathways. Group-contribution methods offer a way to estimate reaction-equilibrium constants at wide coverage across the metabolic network. Here, we present an updated group-contribution method with 1) additional curated thermodynamic data used in fitting and 2) capabilities to calculate equilibrium constants as a function of temperature. We first collected and curated aqueous thermodynamic data, including reaction-equilibrium constants, enthalpies of reaction, Gibbs free energies of formation, enthalpies of formation, entropy changes of formation of compounds, and proton- and metal-ion-binding constants. Next, we formulated the calculation of equilibrium constants as a function of temperature and calculated the standard entropy change of formation ({$\Delta$}(f)S({$\circ$})) using a model based on molecular properties. The median absolute error in estimating {$\Delta$}(f)S({$\circ$}) was 0.013~kJ/K/mol. We also estimated magnesium binding constants for 618 compounds using a linear regression model validated against measured data. We demonstrate the improved performance of the current method (8.17~kJ/mol in median absolute residual) over the current state-of-the-art method (11.47~kJ/mol) in estimating the 185 new reactions added in this work. The efforts here fill in gaps for thermodynamic calculations under various conditions, specifically different temperatures and metal-ion concentrations. These, to our knowledge, new capabilities empower the study of thermodynamic driving forces underlying the metabolic function of organisms living under diverse conditions.},

  abstract = {Reaction equilibrium constants (Keqs) are key parameters that impose thermodynamic constraints on the function of a metabolic network. An important approach for Keq estimation is the group contribution method, which utilizes chemical moiety-based estimates of compound formation energies. In this Opinion, we delineate a number of current challenges with the group contribution method, specifically: (i) problems related to the completeness and quality of data necessary for reliable estimation; and (ii) inadequacies of the method to represent the physical properties of compounds. We then highlight a number of promising approaches to deal with the limitations of group contribution methods. Further advancements should lead to more accurate prediction of equilibrium constants and a better representation of cellular function under biophysical constraints.},

However, thermodynamic data on biochemical compounds can be difficult to find and is cumbersome to perform calculations with manually. Even simple thermodynamic questions like `how much Gibbs energy is released by ATP hydrolysis at pH 5?' are complicated excessively by the search for accurate data. To address this problem, eQuilibrator couples a comprehensive and accurate database of thermodynamic properties of biochemical compounds and reactions with a simple and powerful online search and calculation interface. The web interface to eQuilibrator (http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il) enables easy calculation of Gibbs energies of compounds and reactions given arbitrary pH, ionic strength and metabolite concentrations. The eQuilibrator code is open-source and all thermodynamic source data are freely downloadable in standard formats. Here we describe the database characteristics and implementation and demonstrate its use.},

However, current sampling approaches do not model thermodynamics explicitly, leading to inaccurate predictions of an organism's potential or actual metabolic operations. We present a probabilistic framework combining thermodynamic quantities with steady-state flux constraints to analyze the properties of a metabolic network. It includes methods for probabilistic metabolic optimization and for joint sampling of thermodynamic and flux spaces. Applied to a model of \emph{E. coli}, we use the methods to reveal known and novel mechanisms of substrate channeling, and to accurately predict reaction directions and metabolite concentrations. Interestingly, predicted flux distributions are multimodal, leading to discrete hypotheses on \emph{E. coli} `s metabolic capabilities.
