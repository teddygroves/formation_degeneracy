#+Title: Improving MCMC sampler performance for statistical models of biochemical thermodynamics

* Introduction
Biochemical compounds' formation energies are typically only weakly identified
by measurements of reactions' Gibbs energy changes, leading to slow performance
of Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers under naive statistical model
parameterisations. This paper presents a new parameterisation that improves the
sampler performance, making it feasible to fit Bayesian models of biochemical
formation energies.

To demonstrate that the new parameterisation is effective, the paper includes
two simulation studies: a simple toy example and a larger example based on
publicly available data. In both cases the new parameterisation is shown to
lead to better sampler performance.

* Background
Thermodynamic parameters are important inputs to kinetic models of cellular
metabolism. Much effort has been spent acquiring thermodynamic measurements of
important biochemical reactions in order to quantify these parameters. Bayesian
statistical analysis of this data is desirable it offers a natural way to
accommodate problematic features such as missing measurements, heterogeneity
and the need for uncertainty quantification. However, to our knowledge this has
not previously been done successfully, likely because of the computational
difficulties we identify below.

This section summarises previous work on the quantification of biochemical
thermodynamic parameters, sets out the key issues and explains why Bayesian
statistical models of biochemical thermodynamics are difficult to fit.

** Previous work
cite:duEstimatingMetabolicEquilibrium2018 is a recent review paper describing
the state of the art in estimation of biochemical formation energies. It
explains some of the main challenges, particularly incomplete data
(particularly in the decomposition of compounds into chemical groups),
heterogeneity in informativeness between reactions, and heterogeneity between
different kinds of compounds in the accuracy of the group additivity assumption
(see below).

A difficulty that cite:duEstimatingMetabolicEquilibrium2018 do not address
directly is that there are potential sources of variation and bias in the
adjustment for experimental conditions. For example, the effect of ionic
strength is governed by Debeye-Hükel constants that are not known precisely,
and the effect of magnesium ion concentration depends on microspecies-specific
dissociation constants that are difficult to measure precisely. A further
challenge is that downstream applications, such as kinetic modelling of
biochemical networks, require not just good point estimates of unknown
formation energies but also good overall uncertainty assessments.

** Thermodynamic relationships
The Gibbs energy change of a chemical reaction in aqueous solution, denoted
$\Delta_rG$, is the amount of energy the reaction releases from its reactants
or stores from its environment.  Gibbs free energy changes associated with
biochemical reactions are important properties of metabolic networks. In order
to make inferences about a biochemical system - for example to predict whether
over-expressing an enzyme would help or hinder an organism's metabolism - the
Gibbs energy changes of the system's reactions must either be measured or
inferred.

The Gibbs energy change of a reaction that involves multiple compounds is
determined by the Gibbs energy change of each compound's formation reaction in
standard conditions, denoted $\Delta_fG^{o}$ and generally referred to as
'standard condition formation energy', together with its stoichiometry -
i.e. the number of molecules of each compound that the reaction creates or
consumes - and experimental conditions like temperature, pH, ionic strength and
metal ion concentration. Since the dependency on conditions and stoichiometries
of most biochemical reactions are relatively well understood, the main
challenge in modelling the thermodynamic properties of biochemical reactions is
to estimate standard condition formation energies of their compounds.

*** Relationship between standard condition Gibbs energy change and formation energies
The relationship between a reaction's standard-condition Gibbs free energy
change and the standard-condition formation energies of the reactants is as
follows:

$$
\Delta_r G_j = \sum_{i\ is\ a\ reactant} s_i \Delta_f G_i
$$

where $s_i$ is the stoichiometric coefficient of reactant $i$ in reaction $j$.

For a system of reactions described by stoichiometric matrix $S$, the
relationship can be described as follows:

$$
\Delta_r G = S^T \Delta_f G
$$

*** Relationship between standard condition and condition-specific Gibbs energy changes
The Gibbs energy change of a biochemical reaction at given experimental
conditions is related to the standard-condition measurement by a complicated
but well-understood system of relationships. See
cite:albertyThermodynamicsBiochemicalReactions2003 section 4, 'thermodynamics
of pseudo-isomer groups at specified pH', cite:noorConsistentEstimationGibbs2013
and cite:duTemperatureDependentEstimationGibbs2018 for discussion of these
relationships, and the supplementary material [SECTION?] for as summary.

In this paper we use a curated data-set of reaction measurements that have
already been transformed to their theoretical values at standard conditions.

** Approximate group additivity
The latest approaches to estimating biochemical formation energies,
e.g. cite:noorConsistentEstimationGibbs2013 and
cite:duTemperatureDependentEstimationGibbs2018, assume that compound formation
energies are approximately group additive. This is the case when the formation
energy of a compound is approximately equal to the sum of the formation
energies of its chemical groups. In cite:noorConsistentEstimationGibbs2013 this
assumption is incorporated by fitting two models - one assuming perfect group
additivity ("group contribution") and one assuming no group additivity
("reactant contribution"). The two models are combined using a fall-back
procedure, with the reactant contribution model preferred except for compounds
where no reactant contribution estimate is available.

In the context of a Bayesian statistical model, approximate group additivity
can naturally be taken into account with a multi-level parameter structure. In
this kind of model, compounds' standard condition formation energies are
informed by latent parameters representing the standard condition formation
energies of chemical groups. The relevance of group sum can be determined based
on the data by a higher order parameter.

** Computational issues for structured Bayesian models
The main feature that makes it difficult to apply structured Bayesian modelling
to biochemical thermodynamics is that formation energies are typically only
weakly identified by the available reaction measurements. This happens because
a single reaction measurement is informative only about a linear combination of
the formation energies of its compounds. For example, consider a reaction with
the following stoichiometry:

$$
A + B \leftrightarrow 2C
$$

If this reaction's Gibbs free energy change were measured in standard
conditions, this would provide information as to the value of $2\theta_C -
\theta_A - \theta_B$. In order to fix the value of all three unknowns, three
independent linear combinations would need to be measured or informed by prior
information. 

Unfortunately the available measurements typically do not identify enough
linear combinations to determine the absolute values of all formation energies,
even given perfect measurements. In addition, reaction measurements are
typically very accurate relative to the accuracy of the other available
information about formation energies.

Together these features of the formation energy estimation problem induce what
cite:betancourtmichaelIdentityCrisis2020 terms 'additive degeneracy' in the
target posterior distribution. Instead of concentrating in one region of
parameter space, posterior mass is spread out along comparatively diffuse
surfaces, making the posterior distribution difficult to explore.

Degenerate posterior distributions can often be explored more efficiently when
they are reparameterised. For example, Stan's adaptive HMC algorithm optionally
transforms unknown parameters in order to take into account
correlations. Unfortunately in the case of formation energy estimation the
induced parameter correlations are too extreme for this or other generic
re-parameterisation strategies to be effective. Thus a re-parameterisation
strategy that is tailored to the problem of formation energy estimation seems
to be needed.

* Method

We made a strategy for parameterising Bayesian regression models of biochemical
thermodynamics that addresses the typical additive degeneracy issue. To
demonstrate that it works we made a representative regression model and
compared its behaviour under a naive parameterisation and a re-parameterisation
based on our strategy.

** Modelling approach and reparameterisation strategy
Our full model is as follows:

\begin{align*}
y &\sim N(\Delta_rG, \sigma_r) \\
\Delta_r G &= S^T \theta \\
\theta &\sim Normal(G \gamma, \tau) \\
\theta &\sim Normal(\mu_{\theta}, \sigma_{\theta}) \\
\gamma &\sim Normal(\mu_{\gamma}, \sigma_{\gamma}) \\
\tau &\sim Half\mbox{-} Normal(\mu_{\tau}, \sigma_{\tau}) \\
\end{align*}

where

- $\gamma$ and $\theta$ are vectors representing unknown group and compound
  formation energies respectively
- $tau$ is an unknown positive number representing the inaccuracy of the group
  additivity assumption
- $S$ and $G$ are known matrices representing reaction stoichiometry and group
  incidence respectively
- $\mu_{\theta}$ and $\mu_{gamma}$ are vectors of known prior means for
  compound and group formation energies
- $\sigma_{\theta}$ and $\sigma_{\gamma}$ are vectors of known prior standard
  deviations for compound and group formation energies
- $\mu_{\tau}$ and $\sigma_{\tau}$ are the known prior mean and standard
  deviation for the inaccuracy of the group additivity assumption
  
*** Naive parameterisation
We made two Stan programs implementing our model: one with a naive
parameterisation and one with our new parameterisation.

See cite:carpenterStanProbabilisticProgramming2017 for a description of the
Stan probabilistic programming language.

The naive model is as follows:
#+INCLUDE: "model_naive.stan" src stan

The re-parameterised model does not include a Jacobian adjustment, even though
the target log probability is incremented by the probability density of the
transformed parameter variable ~theta~. This is because the transformation from
~eta_cpd_z~ to ~theta~ is linear - i.e. adding and multiplying by vectors of
constants. Since, for a Bayesian statistical model it is only necessary to know
the posterior density up to proportionality, the Jacobian adjustment can safely
be ignored.

*** New parameterisation
Following cite:albertyEquilibriumCompositionsSolutions1991 we find an
identifiable set of $N_{rxn}$ parameters by multiplying the original parameters
$\theta$ by the reduced row echelon form of the transpose of stoichiometric
matrix, $rref(S^T)$. In order to incorporate pre-experimental information about
the formation energies, we embed $rref(S^{T})$ inside the $N_{cpd}\times N_{cpd}$
identity matrix to define a $N_{cpd}\times N_{cpd}$ transformation matrix
$R$. The procedure for generating $R$ is as follows.

1. Start with a $N_{cpd}\times N_{cpd}$ identity matrix called $R$
2. Find the $N_{cpd} \times N_{rxn}$ stoichiometric matrix $S$.
3. Find the reduced row echelon form of $S^T$, $rref(S^T)$
4. For each of $rref(S^T)$' leading ones, find its row index $i$ and column
   index $j$, and replace row $j$ of $R$ with row $i$ of $rref(S^T)$

The re-parameterised Stan program is as follows:

#+INCLUDE: "model_smart.stan" src stan

The two programs are almost the same, with the only difference being that the
re-parameterised model uses the known matrix ~R_inv~ to define the transformed
parameter ~theta~.

* Results
** Example 1: simple toy case
This section illustrates our method with a worked example.

The stoichiometric matrix $S$ and $rref(S^T)$, the reduced row echelon form of
its transpose are as follows:

$$
S = \left[\begin{matrix}
    0 & 0 & 0 & -1  \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & -1  \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 2   \\
    0 & 0 & -1 & 0  \\
    0 & -1 & -1 & 0 \\
    1 & 1 & 2 & 0   \\
  \end{matrix} \right] \\
rref(S^T) = \left[\begin{matrix}
    1 & 1 & -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0  \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1  \\
  \end{matrix}
\right]
$$

In this the re-parameterisation matrix $R$ is
$$
R = \left[\begin{matrix}
    1 & 1 & -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0  \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{matrix} \right] 
$$ 

with rows 1, 4, 5 and 6 taken from $rref(ST)$ because its leading ones are at
these columns.

If the original parameters were 

$$
\theta = \left[\begin{matrix}
 \theta_1 \\ \theta_2 \\ \theta_3 \\ \theta_4 \\ \theta_5 \\ \theta_6
\end{matrix}\right]
$$

then the transformed parameters would be 

$$
\gamma = R\theta = \left[\begin{matrix}
\theta_{a} - \theta_{b} + 2 \theta_{c}\\\theta_{b}\\\theta_{c}\\\theta_{d}\\\theta_{e}\\\theta_{f}
\end{matrix}\right]
$$

Given $\gamma$, the interpretable parameters $\theta$ can be recovered using
the following relationship:

$$
\theta = R^{-1}\gamma = \left[\begin{matrix}
\gamma_{a} + \gamma_{b} - 2 \gamma_{c}\\\gamma_{b}\\\gamma_{c}\\\gamma_{d}\\\gamma_{e}\\\gamma_{f}
\end{matrix}\right]
$$

*** Simulation study
We ran a simulation study to compare the performance of the naive and
reparameterised models using the stoichiometry specified above and a simulated
data generating process matching the model, with the following true parameters
(all units are kJ/mol):

- $\tau$: 40
- $\sigma_r$: [1, 20, 20, 20]
- $\gamma: [-900, -700, -700, -1910]

We generated values for $theta$ and then simulated measurements $y$ using these
inputs and our model assumptions.

We then fit our model under both parameterisations, using the following priors:

- $\mu_{\theta}$: [-900, -700, -600, -2000, -1400, -2700]
- $\sigma_{\theta}$: [400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400]
- $\mu_{\gamma}$: [-1000, -700, -600, -2000]
- $\sigma_{\gamma}$: [400, 400, 400, 400]
- $\mu_{\tau}$: 50
- $\sigma_{\tau}$: 20

All of these values were chosen to broadly reflect a realistic measurement and
prior information setup.

For each parameterisation we ran 4 Markov chains with 2000 warmup and 2000
sampling iterations per chain. We configured Stan's sampler to use a binary
tree with depth of at most 13 (the default cap is 10) and otherwise used Stan's
default configuration.

Both programs converged satisfactorily. and approximately recovered the
parameters of the true data generating process, as can be seen from the
following graph:

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[./results/simple_case_study/plots/recovery.png]]

Here are a pair of histograms showing the number of leapfrog steps per
iteration that Stan's sampler took while running 4 chains with 1000 iterations
per chain under both parameterisations:

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
[[./results/simple_case_study/plots/leapfrogs.png]]

The sampler tended to take far more leapfrog steps under the new
parameterisation compared to the naive parameterisation, indicating that our
method improved performance in this case.

** Example 2: component contribution data
To test whether the performance improvement extends to more a realistic dataset
we ran a second simulation study with a larger dataset.

We took the stoichiometry for XXX reaction and XXX compounds from the python
library and website [[https://gitlab.com/equilibrator][equilibrator]]
cite:flamholzEQuilibratorBiochemicalThermodynamics2012. We assumed that
equilibrator's group formation energy estimates were true, then used these
values to generate compound formation energies, under the assumption that
compound formation energies are approximately group additive with standard
deviation 50 kJ/mol.

We assumed known measurement error standard deviation of +/-5 kJ/mol for
measurements of non-formation reactions, and +/-200 kJ/mol for formation
reactions. 

We generated one measurement per reaction.

To make the test shorter and remove variation due to different time spent
finding the typical set we initialised all parameters at their true values and
set Stan's initial adaptation window to zero.

*** Adjustment for experimental conditions                         :noexport:
Instead of including experimental conditions in our model explicitly, we do so
by using measurements that have been pre-processed to transform them to
theoretical standard-condition values. This is straightforward thanks to the
maintainers of the python library and website equilibrator, who curate a
suitable data-set. See supplementary material [LINK] for details as to how we
retrieved this data.

There are several potential sources of uncertainty in the adjustment for
experimental conditions:
- The conditions may are recorded inaccurately and sparsely: in many cases
  missing values for ionic strength, pH or ion concentration have to be
  imputed.
- The Debeye-Hükel constants governing the effect of ionic strength are not
  known exactly.
- Dissociation constants are measured with varying degrees of accuracy.

See cite:duEstimatingMetabolicEquilibrium2018 for a discussion of these
issues. For the sake of simplicity this paper does not attempt to model this
uncertainty. 

We note that our model can be extended so as to model the extra sources of
uncertainty explicitly.

*** Results

Figure 1 shows the marginal posterior predictive distributions for the model's
training measurements:

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 700
#+CAPTION: Marginal posterior predictive distributions
[[./results/equilibrator_case_study/plots/predictions.png]]

Very few reaction measurements fall outside the 90% intervals, suggesting a
degree of under-fitting. There also seems to be some systematic bias in the
predictions for measurements of particularly low formation energies, which tend
to be a bit higher than the measurements.

The marginal distributions of compound and group formation energies are shown
in figure 2.

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 700
#+CAPTION: Marginal posterior distributions for compound and group formation energies
[[./results/equilibrator_case_study/plots/marginal_params.png]]

The component contribution estimates are shown in red. By and large the two
models agree as to the best estimates, though there are some systematic
differences for compounds and groups with particularly high and low estimated
formation energy.

Here is a comparison of leapfrog steps taken by the naive and novel samplers:

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
[[./results/equilibrator_case_study/plots/leapfrogs.png]]

Although the novel parameterisation resulted in substantially fewer leapfrog
steps, the difference is not as marked as in the simple toy case study. We
think this is because of the larger role played in the second case study by
group contributions, which were not reparameterised.

* Discussion

The simulation study shows that the reparameterisation works in a case where
the true data generating process matches our model assumptions, recovering the
input while reducing the computational burden compared to the naive
parameterisation. The case study using real data shows that performance
improves with a realistic model and dataset.
